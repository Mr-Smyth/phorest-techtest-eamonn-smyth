# UX

## Purpose of this Project

Build a web application to utilize the Phorest platform and interact with their REST API.  

I will build this application using NodeJs using express. I have chosen this as using JavaScript is a requirement of the role. I considered using Python with perhaps flask or even Django having recently built applications with these libraries/frameworks. However, I am currently learning NodeJs and I do like to push myself to use and learn new tech.   

NodeJS is asynchronous and event-driven. It has 'non-blocking capabilities that allow it to scale to a large number of requests without being slowed down by a few expensive connections.   
Also, NodeJs by nature will allow me to keep my code more modularized and as a result easier to expand on or modify in the future if required.  

I will be using Git version control, with Projects to manage the workflow.   

I will use JEST to run automated tests with mocked data to test the API related logic.

## Goals

### First Objective - Search for Clients
+ Will be able to handle when there are many of the same clients returned (with the same number or email). So if there are two clients returned for the same phone number, the application will display both. 

### Second Objective - Create Vouchers
+ The UI will let you input the amount you want to create the voucher for, and then display that the voucher has been created successfully.

### Bonus Objectives

+ Automated tests

## User Stories

+   As a user I want to be able to search the clients by phone number or email address
+   As a user, when I search I want to get back a list of all the possible results
+   As a user I want to be able to create a voucher for a found client
+   As a user I want to be notified of a successful voucher creation

# UI

I wanted to keep a nice balance between informing the user, and also getting to the goal as quickly as possible. I believe the simplicity of the layout with the information section on the home page and the action button, strikes the right balance.

## Colours

To give a relaxed contrast to the darkness of the Navigation and background image I used variations of Browns and Tans to highlight the text and text areas.  
+ [Tan and Brown](https://www.schemecolor.com/tan-and-brown-color-scheme.php)

## Fonts

I used Luckiest Guy, to give a bolder variation to the site logo.   
For the rest of the content, I used a mixture of Nunito and Poppins.

## Wireframes

The following wireframes were used to layout this project but with plenty of light fonts and a feel-good hero image in the background. Overall I feel the colours and images give a feeling of professionalism, but yet the feel-good factor of a late summer evening.

# Features

### Common features
A site common Navigation and footer

### Home Page

The home page is very simple and clear in what it intends. A call to action button invites the user to get started, also a site introduction explains the process to the user.

### Search Page

The Search page has a clearly defined 2 option search method. You can search by either phone number or by email address. Once the user enters valid information and clicks the search button, the request will be processed and results will be displayed.   

The results will be displayed on top of the original search window, leaving the option to search again if required.   

The user can then select a client from the list of results and they will be taken to the voucher creation page.   

Any search that returns no results will explain this to the user clearly, and give the option to search again.

## Manual Testing:

Multiple calls were made to the API using the application. It handles 404 pages gracefully and every page has a clear indication showing the user at what stage they are at.

For this application, I did not have time to complete full documentation with images of the testing carried out. But see below for a summary of the testing carried out.

All pages were checked for errors in the console, and no errors were found.
