# UX

## Purpose of this Project

Build a web application to utilize the Phorest platform and interact with their REST API.  

I will build this application using NodeJs using express. I have chosen this as it is obviously using JavaScript which is fundemental to the requirements of the role. I considered using Python with perhaps flask or even Django having recently built applications with these libraries/frameworks. However i am currently learning NodeJs and i do like to push myself to use and learn new tech.   

NodeJS is asynchronous and event driven. It has 'non-blocking' capabilities that allow it to scale to a large number of requests without being slowed down by a few expensive connections.   
Also NodeJs by nature will allow me to keep my code more modularized and as a result easier to expand on or modify in the future if required.

## Goals

### First Objective - Search for Clients
+ Will be able to handle when there are many of the same clients returned (with the same number or email). So if there are two clients returned for the same phone number, the application will display both. 

### Second Objective - Create Vouchers
+ The UI will let you input the amount you want to create the voucher for, and then display that the voucher has been created successfully.
